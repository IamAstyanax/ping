# PING - Easily monitor a website or endpoint

PHP Incident Notification Gateway - PING

PING is the stupid simple "Is it up?" application. PING sends emails via PHP to alert if a site is down by either ping or web status. 

PING can be easily configured for different intervals of monitoring such as how often to check if a website is up and the total number of intervals of failure before alerting. 

It is written in easy to read PHP and highly portable in a container.
